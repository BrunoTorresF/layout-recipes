# A collection of common website layouts

Made with pure HTML5 and CSS3 (OK, maybe a tiny bit of JS where necessary).
Meant to be a quick reference for myself and/or a collection of recipes for rapid
prototyping. Also meant as an opportunity to leverage and learn modern CSS3+.

Includes:
  - Single column
  - Zig-zag
  - F-Shape layout
  - Featured Image (Hero)
  - Asymmetrical
  - Split screen
  - Headline with Thumbnails
  - Grid
  - Magazine
  - Boxes
  - Fixed Sidebar
  - Z-shape Layout
